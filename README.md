# Codecademy Learners Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of mockup Codecademy learners data using SQL queries. The data is divided into two tables: `users` and `progress`. The `users` table contains information about learners such as user ID, email domain, country, and sign-up date. The `progress` table tracks the progress of learners in different courses.

## Project Goals
- Analyze the top schools with `.edu` domains among Codecademy learners.
- Determine the number of `.edu` learners located in New York.
- Identify the number of learners using the mobile app.
- Analyze the sign-up counts for each hour.
- Investigate different schools' preferences for Codecademy courses.
- Determine courses preferred by learners from New York and Chicago.

## Files
- `codecademy_learners_data.sql`: SQL script containing queries to analyze the data.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a SQLite database environment (e.g., DB Browser).
3. Execute the SQL script `codecademy_learners_data.sql`.
4. Explore the results of the queries to gain insights into the Codecademy learners' data.

## Usage
The SQL queries provided in `codecademy_learners_data.sql` address various analysis requirements outlined in the project goals. Execute each query to obtain the desired insights into the mockup Codecademy learners data.
