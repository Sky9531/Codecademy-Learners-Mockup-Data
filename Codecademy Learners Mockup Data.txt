2: Exploring the Data

-- Top 25 schools (.edu domains)
SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
WHERE email_domain LIKE '%.edu'
GROUP BY email_domain
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 25;

-- Number of .edu learners located in New York
SELECT COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
WHERE email_domain LIKE '%.edu'
AND country = 'New York';

-- Number of learners using the mobile app
SELECT COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
WHERE mobile_app = 'mobile-user';




3: Sign-up Counts for Each Hour

SELECT strftime('%H', sign_up_at) as hour, COUNT(*) as sign_up_count
FROM users
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;



4: Analyzing Data with Joins

-- Joining users and progress tables
SELECT u.email_domain, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users u
JOIN progress p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.email_domain
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Courses preferred by New Yorkers
SELECT p.learn_cpp, p.learn_sql, p.learn_html, p.learn_javascript, p.learn_java, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users u
JOIN progress p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE u.country = 'New York'
GROUP BY p.learn_cpp, p.learn_sql, p.learn_html, p.learn_javascript, p.learn_java;

-- Courses preferred by Chicago students
SELECT p.learn_cpp, p.learn_sql, p.learn_html, p.learn_javascript, p.learn_java, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users u
JOIN progress p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE u.country = 'Chicago'
GROUP BY p.learn_cpp, p.learn_sql, p.learn_html, p.learn_javascript, p.learn_java;
